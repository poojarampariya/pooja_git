My bad habits leads to late night standing alone
Conversations with the stranger I barely know
Swearing this will be the last time 
It probably wont
Ive got nothing else to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits leads to wide eyes staring at space
And I know I loose control of the things that I say
Nothing happens after two its true
My bad habits lead to you


Hello


Hey Hey Hey why you wearing that to walk out of my life
I know its over but you should stay tonight
